Mini Password Manager
=====================

Mini Password Manager is a very minimalistic password manager app for android that provides basic password storing capability to users who like to keep things simple and straight.

You do not have to remember even a single password with this app, as it uses a pattern login mechanism instead of a master password to login.
Mini Password Manager uses AES-128 bit encryption algorithm to encrypt the data stored for which the key is generated based on the login pattern set. On changing login pattern the entire database is re-encrypted with the new key.

Mini Password Manager can be downloaded from Play Store at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buildacode.tpmfree">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buildacode.tpmfree</a>.
